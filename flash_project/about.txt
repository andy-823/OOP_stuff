It can be called group project (this code is a result of group work).
Its idea is to write files of minimal size to cover damaged blocks on flash.
Program creates something like tree and writes files of start file size.
Folder tree was created because flash starts lagging when there are many files in directory.
After no empty space left it compares written files to what had to be written.
If written file is incorrect, program replaces it with smaller files, and so on.

Now it doesn't work correctly, but you can test it:).
